# My Fullstack App

## Overview
This project is a fullstack application that consists of a client-side React application and a server-side Node.js application. The client communicates with the server to fetch and manipulate data.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two main directories: `client` and `server`.

### Client
The client-side application is built using React and TypeScript. It includes the following key files and directories:
- `src/index.tsx`: The entry point for the React application.
- `src/App.tsx`: The main App component.
- `src/components/`: Contains reusable components like `DataTable.tsx`.
- `src/pages/`: Contains page components like `Dashboard.tsx`.
- `src/services/`: Contains API wrapper functions for making HTTP requests.
- `src/types/`: Contains TypeScript interfaces and types.

### Server
The server-side application is built using Node.js and Express. It includes the following key files and directories:
- `src/index.ts`: The entry point for the server application.
- `src/config/`: Contains configuration files, including database setup.
- `src/routes/`: Contains route definitions using Express Router.
- `src/controllers/`: Contains request handler logic.
- `src/models/`: Contains database models.
- `src/services/`: Contains business logic.
- `src/middleware/`: Contains middleware functions for authentication and error handling.
- `src/utils/`: Contains utility functions and helpers.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-fullstack-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   - For the client:
     ```
     cd client
     npm install
     ```
   - For the server:
     ```
     cd server
     npm install
     ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:
   ```
   DB_URL=<your-database-url>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
   ```

4. Start the development servers:
   - For the client:
     ```
     cd client
     npm start
     ```
   - For the server:
     ```
     cd server
     npm start
     ```

## Usage
Once both servers are running, you can access the client application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your client configuration). The client will communicate with the server to fetch and display data.
